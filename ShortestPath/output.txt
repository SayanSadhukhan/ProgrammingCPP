The adjacency list for the given graph: 
1: {2,2} {4,1} 
2: {1,2} {3,4} {5,5} 
3: {2,4} {4,3} {5,1} 
4: {1,1} {3,3} 
5: {2,5} {3,1} 

Shortest path according to Dijkstra's algorithm: 
0 2 4 1 5 
Route for 1 from source(1): 1

Route for 2 from source(1): 1

Route for 3 from source(1): 4->1

Route for 4 from source(1): 1

Route for 5 from source(1): 3->4->1
